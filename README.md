# Master Thesis 'Emotion Recognition In-The-Wild' - User Survery

Using a machine learning toolkit of your choice, create a tool which identifies objects in the image, then returns positions in pixels corresponding to bounding boxes of a user-selected class of object in the image. For example, given an image with both cats and dogs, return bounding boxes for only cats.
